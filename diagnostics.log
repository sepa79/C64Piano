# WASM diagnostics log

This log captures the instrumentation hooks added in Phase 1 and expanded in later phases. Run the app in a browser with the
console open to observe the `[WASM-DEBUG]` messages emitted from the loader and the heartbeats emitted by the AudioWorklet.

Expected events:
- `[WASM-DEBUG] fetch sid.wasm` / `fetch sid.wasm success` when the external WASM binary is fetched. If the fetch fails, a
  fallback warning is emitted before decoding the embedded base64 payload.
- `[WASM-DEBUG] addModule:start` / `addModule:success` when the AudioWorklet is registered.
- `wasm-loaded` and `wasmReady` messages from the worklet once the WASM binary has been transferred, instantiated, and prefilling
  has completed. `queuedSamples` reflects the size of the prefilled ring buffer.
- Periodic `proc-diagnostic` messages with `procMs`, `samplesProduced`, `queuedSamples`, and `quantumMs` fields while audio is
  rendering.
- `proc-warning` events if per-quantum processing time exceeds the budget derived from the audio context's sample rate.
- `wasm-error` messages if instantiation or rendering fails.

Collect these logs by opening the developer console, switching to the WASM engine, and triggering a note.
